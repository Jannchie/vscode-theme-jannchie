<h1 align="center">Jannchie's Theme for VS Code</h1>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jannchie/vscode-theme-jannchie/main/shapshot.png" alt="preview" width="100%">

This is a vscode theme I made for myself.

I want to highlight important code - like custom functions. At the same time, I've made the less important code - like built-in function calls - less eye-catching.

It may still need tweaking. But for a first version, I think it already looks cool.

## Thanks
